## Package Parameters

- `/InstallDir` - Install/unpack to a custom location. Chocolatey will remove files from this custom location on uninstall but **WILL NOT** upgrade files in this custom location without using the `/InstallDir` parameter again.

## Notes

- **This software in this package _requires_ a minimum of version 11 of a Java Runtime Engine. It will not work without one.** As there are so many flavours of Java I leave it to you to choose the one your prefer. My current recommendation is [Temurin](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/Temurinjre) if you don't already have one installed. See the [Solr Java Requirements](https://solr.apache.org/guide/solr/latest/deployment-guide/system-requirements.html#java-requirements) for more information.
- The Solr binaries are extracted to the `solr-<VERSION_NUMBER>` folder of the local tools folder (by default `c:\tools` - see [`Get-ToolsLocation`](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/functions/get-toolslocation) for more information). This is consistent with previous versions.
- **NOTE**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
